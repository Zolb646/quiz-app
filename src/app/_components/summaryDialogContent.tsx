        Genghis Khan, born Temüjin around 1162, was the founder of the Mongol
        Empire. After his father's death, Temüjin's family was left in poverty,
        and he later killed his half-brother to secure his position. He built
        alliances with leaders like Jamukha and Toghrul, and despite being
        defeated in battle and briefly under the Jin dynasty, he rose to power
        by defeating rivals. By 1206, after overcoming the Naiman tribe and
        executing Jamukha, Temüjin became the undisputed ruler of the Mongol
        steppe, eventually leading a series of successful military campaigns
        that expanded his empire across China and Central Asia. Genghis Khan,
